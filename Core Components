Data Collection
Source publicly available credit risk datasets such as Kaggle Credit Risk Dataset and UCI Credit Approval Dataset.
Include applicant demographic, financial, and credit history attributes.
Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
Handle missing values using statistical imputation or model-based techniques.
Remove duplicates and treat outliers to reduce noise.

Engineer domain-specific features such as:
Credit utilization ratio
Income-to-loan ratio
Debt-to-income ratio
Payment history indicators
Model Development

Train and compare multiple machine learning models:
Logistic Regression (baseline and interpretability)
Random Forest (non-linear relationships)
XGBoost (high performance and robustness)
Neural Networks (complex pattern learning)
Perform hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation.
Explainable AI (XAI)
Apply SHAP and LIME to interpret model predictions.
Provide global feature importance and local, instance-level explanations.
Enable transparency in credit approval and rejection decisions for regulatory compliance.

Model Evaluation
Evaluate models using multiple performance metrics:
Accuracy
ROC-AUC
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Compare trade-offs between performance and interpretability.
Deployment
Develop an interactive web application using Streamlit or Flask.
Allow loan officers to:
Input applicant details
View credit risk predictions
Access explanation visualizations (feature contributions)
Ensure usability for real-world decision support.
