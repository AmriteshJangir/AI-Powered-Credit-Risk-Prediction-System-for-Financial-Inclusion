# AI-Powered-Credit-Risk-Prediction-System-for-Financial-Inclusion Using Pipelining Automation and engaging llms
To build and showcase a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default — using real-world financial data and ethical AI techniques to support responsible lending and inclusion.

#Problem Statement:
Banks and fintech companies struggle to assess credit risk accurately, especially for new or low-income applicants with limited financial history. Traditional models rely heavily on outdated metrics. This project uses AI-driven risk assessment to make lending more inclusive, fair, and data-driven.
